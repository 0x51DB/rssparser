By Friday night, however, some protesters joined by other militias had armed themselves and heavy gunfire rang out in the Tripoli neighbourhood where the attack happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The march in the capital by thousands of protesters was the biggest show of public anger at militias in months. Since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi, hundreds of militias – many of them on government payroll – have run out of control in Libya, carving out zones of power, defying state authority and launching violent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters marched from a central mosque to the headquarters of a militia originally from the city of Misrata that has a powerful presence in Tripoli. They waved Libyan and white flags and chanted, "We want an army, we want police," referring to demands that the country's weak security forces take the place of militias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they neared the building, militiamen in civilian clothes and military uniforms came out of the headquarters, opening fire at the protesters with automatic weapons, RPGs and anti-aircraft guns. Protesters ran from gunfire while carrying others covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official at Tripoli emergency hospital said it had the bodies of 15 dead protesters. Libya's official news agency LANA quoted a medical official at Tripoli's central hospital as saying it had the bodies of seven dead protesters, bringing the death toll from the initial assault to at least 22. The agency said the attack wounded more than 130 people, leaving many in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnesses all said the protesters carried no weapons. Al-Taher Basha Agha, commander of Misrata-based militia, told Libya's private al-Ahrar television station that the protesters were armed and opened fire first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if he would leave Tripoli, the commander said that his men will leave only "dead bodies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tripoli has not seen a war yet, it will see it soon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeidan also blamed both protesters and the militiamen for the violence in a televised news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't open fire at people who are exchanging fire," Zidan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters said they were shocked by the prime minister's comments, pointing to an image of a bleeding elderly man shared on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is delusional," protester Abdel-Karim al-Beriki said. "The first martyr was a man in his seventies. How could he be carrying a weapon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya's militias grew out of the informally created local brigades of rebels who battled Gaddafi's military. Since his fall and death, the militias have mushroomed in number, size and power. With the army and police still weak, the government has turned to militias to keep security, giving them tasks guarding facilities or districts. But the government pay has not put them under state control, and the armed groups – some of which include Islamic militants – act on their own agendas. Many of them were engaged in kidnappings, torture, assassinations and taking the law into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has put a December deadline on groups to join state security forces or face losing their government paychecks though it is not clear if the government will carry out the threat, since it could spark a powerful backlash. It has made similar threats in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many militias have turned villas and residential compounds of former Gaddafi-era officials into camps where they stash weapons and impose control over certain areas. Eastern militias also have seized control of oil exporting terminals, sending production plunging from 1.4m barrels a day to around few hundred thousand, robbing the country of its main revenue source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's march was prompted by a string of incidents involving militias most recently, street clashes between the Misrata militia and one from Tripoli. The fight was sparked by the killing of one of the Misrata group's commanders, and the gun battles in the street panicked residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Sadat al-Badri, the head of Tripoli's city council, called for three-day mourning in the capital while urging residents for "self-restraint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reaction was reminiscent of a similar scene last year in the eastern city of Benghazi, where thousands of protesters besieged headquarters of Islamic militias, forcing them to flee and clashed with others where dozens were killed. The protests came days after the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in a deadly attack on an American mission in Benghazi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the US state department said it had been quietly offering rewards since January of up to $10m for information leading to the arrest or conviction of any person involved in the Benghazi attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It left the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons without a country to host the destruction of Syria's estimated 1,000-tonne arsenal, which includes mustard gas and the deadly nerve agent sarin. Syria says it wants the weapons destroyed outside the country, which has been devastated by the ongoing civil war, and the OPCW has described that as the "most viable" option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a televised address from the capital, Tirana, the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, said it was "impossible for Albania to take part in this operation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was greeted by a loud cheer from some 2,000 protesters camped outside Rama's office to show their strong opposition to the plan, fearing it would be an environmental and health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albania had been considered the OPCW's strongest hope, as few diplomats had expected the Mediterranean nation of 2.8 million people to reject what Rama said had been a direct request from the United States. A meeting on Friday morning of the OPCW's executive council in The Hague had been adjourned to work on the wording of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albania, a member of Nato, is one of only three nations worldwide that have declared a chemical weapons stockpile to the OPCW and destroyed it. Nations including the US and Russia also have declared stockpiles, but have not yet completed their destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, a US state department spokeswoman, Jan Psaki, told reporters that the decision would not hurt US-Albanian relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We appreciate Albania looking seriously at hosting the destruction of chemical weapons," she said. "The international community continues to discuss the most effective and expeditious means for eliminating Syria's chemical weapons program in the safest manner possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tirana has been an avid supporter of Washington since the US and Nato intervened with airstrikes in 1999 to stop a crackdown by Serb forces on rebel ethnic Albanians in neighbouring Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the United States, Albanians would never have been free and independent in two countries that they are today," Rama said in an apologetic speech. "Without the United States, today there would surely be no demonstrations about chemical weapons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the plan was unpopular at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have the infrastructure here to deal with the chemical weapons. We can't deal with our own stuff, let alone Syrian weapons," said Maria Pesha, a 19-year-old architecture student, among the protesters camped out overnight outside Rama's office. "We have no duty to obey anyone on this, Nato or the US"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albania has had problems with ammunition storage in the past. In March 2008, an explosion at an ammunition dump at Gerdec near Tirana killed 26 people, wounded 300 others and destroyed or damaged 5,500 houses. Investigators said it was caused by a burning cigarette in a factory where some 1,400 tons of explosives, mostly obsolete artillery shells, were stored for disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rama said he decided to reject the request because other countries, which he did not name, were not prepared to be part of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If some other countries would have moved in time to be part of this operation I would have been ready to tell you: this is our plan, here is the agreement with our partners, here is how little we will risk and how much we will gain morally as a nation and physically as a country," Rama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately this element, [as] important for me as it is for you, is today absent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever and whenever it happens, the destruction of Syria's weapons will be overseen by experts from the Hague-based OPCW, which won the Nobel peace prize this year for its efforts to eradicate poison gas and nerve agents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Syrian chemical disarmament mission stems from a deadly attack in August on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in which the United Nations concluded that sarin was used. Hundreds of people were killed. The US and western allies accuse Syria's government of being responsible, while Damascus blames the rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration threatened to launch punitive missile strikes against Syria, prompting frantic diplomatic efforts to forestall an attack. Those efforts concluded with September's unanimous UN security council resolution endorsing the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, international inspectors have visited 22 of the 23 chemical weapons sites declared by Syria and have confirmed that Damascus met a 1 November deadline to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chemical-weapons"&gt;Chemical weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/opcw"&gt;OPCW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This ignores the scientific evidence from the US, where large-scale intensive farming systems have become the norm, showing there are real risks to human health from mega farms because of their routine use of antibiotics. There is also new evidence from the Netherlands, where a strain of MRSA was found more frequently and in higher concentrations in the air within 1km of intensive pig and poultry farms. The UK's chief medical officer recently stated that the problems of antibiotic resistance in humans means we are facing a human health crisis, and that this is linked in part to antibiotic use in intensive livestock farming. This was raised at the recent G8 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is not to create huge-scale, intensive, indoor livestock operations that threaten our landscape, farming and rural communities. Large-scale industrial farms may be able to produce food a little more cheaply in the short term, but we risk ending up paying a high price in terms of the loss of antibiotics that save millions of lives, to say nothing of the cost to the animals themselves. We need to eat less but better-quality meat, from farming systems that respect animals and allow them to enjoy natural behaviours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emma Hockridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head of policy, Soil Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Despite high levels of support from the public purse, our current food system is leaving growing numbers in food poverty and is leading to widening inequalities in health. It is also exerting a heavy toll on the environment and preventing many farmers from receiving a fair price for their produce. Rather than further intensification of livestock farming, we need a resilient, diverse approach to food and farming. We need an approach that will halt and reverse the decline in all the things that people love about our countryside: plentiful wildlife; a varied landscape; farm animals enjoying life out of doors; and fresh, seasonal, local food which can be bought at fair prices, while providing a reasonable livelihood for the people who produce it. Farming and food are not just issues for academics and vested interests – we all have a stake in getting this right. The first step is moving food, farming and the countryside right up the political agenda, and reconnecting people with where their food comes from, and how it is produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sue Armstrong-Brown&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;RSPB&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dan Crossley&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Food Ethics Council&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sue Dibb &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eating Better&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Vicki Hird&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Friends of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tim Lang&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Centre for Food Policy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jeanette Longfield&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sustain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Paul Wilkinson&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Wildlife Trusts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Your article states "only 2% of dairy farms keep their cattle indoors all year round, compared with as many as 90% in the US". Having seen first-hand the terrible impact of mega dairies in California on the environment and on farmers trying to make ends meet, I can say that following the US down the road of intensification and ever-larger indoor only dairy farms would be a huge error. In the debate around feeding our growing population, we should be very clear that the consumer only picks up part of the bill. Someone, or something, has to pay the price for cheap meat and dairy products and all too often the unsustainable burden falls on the environment and the animals that provide them. We must be more effective at putting food in people's mouths by reducing food losses and wastes; by getting farm animals off human-edible grain and fishmeal and feeding them on grass, forage and food wastes; by returning to mixed farming which restores soils and by avoiding the over-consumption of meat and dairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philip Lymbery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;CEO, Compassion in World Farming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Last week the headlines were about Brits and our wanton wastage of food (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/07/uk-households-food-waste" title=""&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt;, 7 November). We slaughter approx 1bn animals each year – most are farmed in fetid sheds. Animals suffer and die for us to eat yet each day we trash 1m eggs, 1.5m sausages and 6m glasses of milk and the equivalent of 86m chickens are trashed each year too. This week we have "influential farming experts" telling us we need even more intensive livestock farming to "keep food prices down". No doubt so we can trash even more animals without a financial care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sara Starkey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tonbridge, Kent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/antibiotics"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/animal-welfare"&gt;Animal welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/animals"&gt;Animals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/mrsa"&gt;MRSA and superbugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/food"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks"&gt;Food banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/food-safety"&gt;Food safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/food-poverty"&gt;Food poverty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty"&gt;Poverty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Long tailbacks in the Venezuelan capital can quickly be aggravated by protesters angry about pensions or security. But this week there was a different kind of delay: dozens of illegally parked cars jammed the traffic outside an electronics shop. Inside, people were buying knockdown goods as if their lives depended on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Living here is like a cartoon," Becerra says. "Most of us can't find milk to drink, let alone to produce, and the president's best plan is to lower the prices of TVs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was referring to president Nicolás Maduro's recent moves to get shopkeepers to slash their prices. Maduro has spoken of jailing retailers, criticising the "speculation and usury" that he blames for Venezuela's economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concerns are mounting that his actions are just treating the symptoms, not the causes of Venezuela's sudden financial lurch, and that although it might give his citizens a nice cheap early Christmas, the new year hangover threatens to be painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a slap in the face to be told this is socialism and to see the government hand out electronics while most of us struggle to find food. There is no long-term plan," said Becerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's economic wobble stems from strict currency and price controls imposed by the former president Hugo Chávez. Despite years of high oil prices, the distortions that these have caused in the economy have led to shortages, difficulties for local industries that are not oil-related and a flourishing black market laced with corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tell-tale signs of distress are multiplying. Queues outside grocery stores proliferate. Absurdly, the shops lack local staples – sugar, milk, flour – but are well stocked with subsidised imports such as single-malt whisky and Italian panettone. The black market rate for dollars has soared to 10 times the official rate. Inflation has rocketed to 54%, an all-time high. Capital continues to flee the country. More and more Venezuelans are watching their salary and life savings eroded. The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, warned last month that Venezuela was undergoing economic stress and would have to make some difficult policy decisions soon because it was running down its currency reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a balance-of-payments crisis in slow motion," said Alejandro Grisanti, a Barclays economist. "It's impossible for hard currency to flow to the productive sector of the economy. He added that most went on dummy companies and state-subsidised imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Maduro has blamed the country's economic disaster on "economic warfare" waged by an opposition seeking to destabilise his government. For now, his populist move to bring prices down has found favour. For many people, buying a refrigerator or a wide-screen TV was a distant dream that Maduro has now made possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was long overdue," said Ivonne Mendoza, 37, a teacher. "Importers get cheap dollars but charge as if they didn't. I don't get it, but I also don't get why after 10 years of abuse the government kept giving them money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Maduro, the decision to increase controls, which comes a month before municipal elections that could amount to a referendum on his presidency, is a counter-offensive to his enemies' attempts to oust him. Maduro has insisted he will remain in power despite the efforts of a "parasitic bourgeoisie" to bleed the country dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some analysts, these price-busting efforts might help Maduro politically but will do little to solve the economy's structural problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These have been politically motivated moves. [Among supporters] the common perception has been that Maduro is finally governing. That somehow, he is punishing the evil speculators and accompanying the people in their plight," said Luís Vicente León, a pollster and director of Datanalisis. "But the effects for the economy, come January, will be dire. No one will restock inventories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One liquor-shop owner who preferred to be named simply as David explained the problem for businesspeople, retailers, importers – anyone who is uncertain whether they will be able to get dollars at the cheap official rate from the state Cadivi agency, or the prohibitively costly black market rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you bring in a bottle of Grey Goose vodka at the official rate you can sell the cheapest vodka in the world, but if you are having to pay black market rate you get the most expensive," David said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I buy from distributors who haven't gotten [central bank] dollars in four years. They are in debt with their providers and have logically lost their line of credit." A bottle of high-end vodka in his shop sells for approximately $222 (£134) at the official rate, or $21 on the black market. The same bottle sells for $28 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro has acknowledged that there is corruption behind the currency controls. He has declared war on the parallel market, which includes shutting down 70 web pages that report the daily rates, but has failed to outline any plan to lift the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Maduro announced the arrest of more than 100 "bourgeois" businessmen in the crackdown on alleged price-gouging. "They are barbaric, these capitalist parasites!" Maduro said in a televised speech. "We have more than 100 of the bourgeoisie behind bars at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's time to deepen the offensive, go to the bone in this economic war," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro said the forced price cuts should lead to negative inflation of 15% in November and 50% in December – forecasts that brought immediate mockery from critics on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade of ever-increasing margins between the two currencies has meant that those with access to state dollars have made large fortunes. For many this has discouraged local production and has bred rampant corruption, from importers who overprice, to government officials getting a cut of the approved quota, and even one unnamed motorcar racer who got more than $60m for "sports activities" abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cadivi is the best business in town. I have made up to $35,000 a month on a $250,000 transaction", says a small-time black market dealer of the margins in his line of work. "People – and companies – here make a lot of money but they want to take it out [to offshore accounts].If the government doesn't approve your quota, you go to the black market. You lose some money but at least you got it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the pollster Luís Vicente León, a terminal crisis or a social explosion is unlikely as long as oil prices remain high, but the hard-hit economy will continue to keep Becerra and many more up at night. "We might see an economy of war with few shops opened and more people buying food off trucks instead of stores."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro"&gt;Nicolás Maduro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies"&gt;Currencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/commodities"&gt;Commodities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/virginia-lopez"&gt;Virginia López&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He is now the world's clearest voice for change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Obama poster on the wall, promising hope and change, is looking a little faded now. The disappointments, whether over drone warfare or a botched rollout of healthcare reform, have left the world's liberals and&amp;nbsp;progressives searching for a new pin-up to take the US president's place. As it happens, there's an obvious candidate: the head of an organisation those same liberals and progressives have long regarded as sexist, homophobic and, thanks to a series of child abuse scandals, chillingly cruel. The obvious new hero of the left is the pope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/19/pople-francis-inauguration-crowds-gather" title=""&gt;installed in March, Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt; has already become a phenomenon. His is &lt;a href="http://cnsblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/pope-francis-ranks-1-most-talked-about-name-on-the-net/" title=""&gt;the most talked-about name on the internet in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, ranking ahead of "Obamacare" and "NSA". In fourth place&amp;nbsp;comes Francis's Twitter handle, @Pontifex. In Italy, Francesco has fast become the most popular name for new baby boys. Rome reports a surge in tourist numbers, while church attendance is said to be up – both trends attributed to "&lt;a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/11/11/rise-italian-catholic-church-attendance-attributed-francis-effect/" title=""&gt;the Francis effect&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His popularity is not hard to fathom. The stories of his personal modesty have become the stuff of instant legend. He carries his own suitcase. He refused the grandeur of the papal palace, preferring to live in a simple hostel. When presented with the traditional red shoes of the pontiff, he declined; instead he telephoned his 81-year-old cobbler in Buenos Aires and asked him to repair his old ones. On Thursday, Francis visited the Italian president – &lt;a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268743/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=ODdpkYmN" title=""&gt;arriving in a blue Ford Focus&lt;/a&gt;, with not a blaring siren to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some will dismiss these acts as mere gestures, even publicity stunts. But they convey a powerful message, one of almost elemental egalitarianism. He is in the business of scraping away the trappings, the edifice of Vatican wealth accreted over centuries, and returning the church to its core purpose, one Jesus himself might have recognised. He says he wants to preside over "a poor church, for the poor". It's not the institution that counts, it's the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this would warm the heart of even&amp;nbsp;the most fervent atheist, except Francis has gone much further. It seems he wants to do more than simply stroke the brow of the weak. He is taking on the system that has made them weak and keeps them that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My thoughts turn to all who are unemployed, often as a result of a self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost," &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pontifex/statuses/329913658857639937" title=""&gt;he tweeted in May&lt;/a&gt;. A day earlier he &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22370487" title=""&gt;denounced as "slave labour"&lt;/a&gt; the conditions endured by Bangladeshi workers killed in a building collapse. In September he said that God wanted men and women to be at the heart of the world and yet we live in a global economic order that worships "an idol called money".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no denying the radicalism of this message, a frontal and sustained attack on what he calls "&lt;a href="http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/05/22/pope-francis-warns-of-the-dangers-of-unbridled-capitalism/" title=""&gt;unbridled capitalism&lt;/a&gt;", with its "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/393730042770903040" title=""&gt;throwaway&lt;/a&gt;" attitude to everything from unwanted food to unwanted old people. His enemies have certainly not missed it. If a man is to be judged by his opponents, note that this week &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2013/11/15/sarah-palin-pope-francis-liberal-comments/3574167/" title=""&gt;Sarah Palin denounced him as "kind of liberal"&lt;/a&gt; while the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs has lamented that this pope lacks the &lt;a href="http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/why-does-pope-francis-criticise-the-malign-effects-of-capitalism-on-countries-that-don%E2%80%99t-know-c" title=""&gt;"sophisticated" approach&lt;/a&gt; to such matters of his predecessors. Meanwhile, an Italian prosecutor has warned that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/13/pope-francis-mafia-target-corruption" title=""&gt;Francis's campaign against corruption&lt;/a&gt; could put him in the crosshairs of that country's second most powerful institution: the mafia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if this weren't enough to have Francis's 76-year-old face on the walls of the world's student bedrooms, he also seems set to lead a church campaign on the environment. He was photographed this week with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/other98/statuses/400711405252272128" title=""&gt;anti-fracking activists&lt;/a&gt;, while his &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pope-Francis-Untying-Paul-Vallely/dp/1472903706" title=""&gt;biographer, Paul Vallely&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed that the pope has made contact with Leonardo Boff, an eco-theologian previously shunned by Rome and sentenced to "obsequious silence" by the office formerly known as the "Inquisition". An encyclical on care for the planet is said to be on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many on the left will say that's all very welcome, but meaningless until the pope puts his own house in order. But here, too, the signs are encouraging. Or, more accurately, stunning. Recently, Francis told an interviewer the church had become "obsessed" with abortion, gay marriage and contraception. He no longer wanted the Catholic hierarchy to be preoccupied with "small-minded rules". Talking to reporters on a flight – an occurrence remarkable in itself – he said: "&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/pope-francis-gay-priests" title=""&gt;If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?&lt;/a&gt;" His latest move is to &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24951677" title=""&gt;send the world's Catholics a questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, seeking their attitude to those vexed questions of modern life. It's bound to reveal a flock whose practices are, shall we say, at variance with Catholic teaching. In politics, you'd say Francis was preparing&amp;nbsp;the ground for reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witness his reaction to a letter – sent to "His Holiness Francis, Vatican City" – from a single woman, pregnant by a married man who had since abandoned her. To her astonishment, the pope telephoned her directly and told her that if, as she feared, priests refused to baptise her baby, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/10290681/Pope-Francis-promises-to-baptise-unmarried-womans-child-in-latest-phone-call.html" title=""&gt;he would perform the ceremony himself&lt;/a&gt;. (Telephoning individuals who write to him is a Francis habit.) Now contrast that with the past Catholic approach to such "fallen women", dramatised so powerfully in the current film Philomena. He is replacing brutality with empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, he is not perfect. His record in Argentina during the era of dictatorship and "dirty war" is far from clean. "He started off as a strict authoritarian, reactionary figure," says Vallely. But, aged 50, Francis underwent a spiritual crisis from which, says his biographer, he emerged utterly transformed. He ditched the trappings of high church office, went into the slums and got his hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now inside the Vatican, he faces a different challenge – to &lt;a href="http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/10/04/pope-and-cardinals-to-completely-overhaul-the-curia-says-spokesman/" title=""&gt;face down the conservatives of the curia&lt;/a&gt; and lock in his reforms, so that they cannot be undone once he's gone. Given the guile of those courtiers, that's quite a task: he'll need all the support he can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some will say the world's leftists and liberals shouldn't hanker for a pin-up, that the urge is infantile and bound to end in disappointment. But the need is human and hardly confined to the left: think of the Reagan and Thatcher posters that still adorn the metaphorical walls of conservatives, three decades on. The pope may have no army, no battalions or divisions, but he has a pulpit – and right now he is using it to be&amp;nbsp;the world's loudest and clearest voice&amp;nbsp;against the status quo. You don't have to be a believer to believe in that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Freedland" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Freedland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-papacy"&gt;The papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland"&gt;Jonathan Freedland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

See how countries compare for road safety and what else the report tells us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2013/en/index.html"&gt;global status report on road safety&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year by the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that approximately 1.24m people die every year on the world's roads and that 27% of all road traffic deaths are pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/fifth-london-bike-death-bus-superhighway"&gt;Five cycling deaths in nine days&lt;/a&gt; has put the safety of London's roads heavily into focus with coverage on cycling safety ranging from which &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/cycling-deaths-met-police-bernard-hogan-howe-london"&gt;vehicles are the most dangerous to cyclists&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/oct/31/uk-learn-japan-cycling-culture"&gt;how cycling culture differs by country&lt;/a&gt;. The WHO report gives an interesting insight into how road safety differs by country and how cyclists fare in different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the road safety report only 68 countries have national or subnational policies to promote walking and cycling, and just 79 countries have policies that protect pedestrians and cyclists by separating them from motorized and high-speed traffic. WHO warned that although more should be done to encourage cyclists and pedestrians, "additional criteria" need to be put into place by policy-makers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="quoted"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging children to walk to school without providing pavements or safe places to cross the road, or reducing the speed of traffic, could in fact lead to increased injuries. Promoting city cycling to reduce congestion cannot be encouraged if cyclists repeatedly find that their lanes cut across oncoming traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures to separate walkers and cyclists from other road users in conjunction with speed management interventions are particularly important if such policies are to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries attempting to encourage people to walk and cycle instead of using motorised transport but without the infrastructure policies to support this could "potentially increase risks for road traffic injuries" they insisted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable road users (cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists) make up half of all road traffic deaths in the world, according to the WHO, with the low-income countries recording the highest proportion of deaths among this group of road users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphic above, from the report, shows road traffic deaths by type of road user in each of the WHO regions. It shows that cyclists account for 5% of all road traffic deaths in the world. The western Pacific is the WHO region with the highest proportion of cyclist fatalities as a proportion of all road traffic deaths. Cyclists account for 4% of Europe's road traffic deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do the WHO recommend to reduce pedestrian and cyclist deaths? Some of the recommendations made in the report are below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Lowering urban speeds - "Setting speed limits according to the designated function of particular roads is an effective measure to reduce road traffic injuries." The WHO reports that countries which have adopted universal urban speed limits of 50km/h include Australia and Sweden - considered to be "leaders in road safety".&lt;br /&gt;• Governments need to make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists - "In planning road construction projects, there has been insufficient attention given to preventing the negative effects of motorisation from falling most heavily on these road users most at risk."&lt;br /&gt;• Safer roads - "More needs to be done by governments to make their road infrastructures safer. Only 63 countries meet all three criteria specified here - that is, they carry out road safety inspections on all new road infrastructure projects as well as on existing road infrastructure projects, and they ensure that assessments are conducted by independent assessors"&lt;br /&gt;• Make vehicles safer for non-car road users - They claim that since the 70s "crash engineers have known that, in addition to reducing vehicle speeds, changing the shape and stiffness of vehicle fronts would significantly reduce the severity of injuries sustained by pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists when hit by a vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report sums up the recommendations by stating that "reducing road traffic deaths requires more consideration of the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists". The data below from the report shows the distribution of road deaths by the type of road user. The year covered by the data is also included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has also created an &lt;a href="http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/road_safety/road_traffic_deaths3/atlas.html"&gt;interactive&lt;/a&gt; using the same data which shows the number of road traffic deaths and distribution by type of road user. The initial map shows the total number of road traffic deaths and when you click on an individual country, a chart is displayed showing how this breaks down by road user type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think could be done to make roads safer for vulnerable road users? Do you agree with the WHO's recommendations?

But in Colombo, President Mahinda Rajapaksa's brother-in-law, Lalith Chandradasa, a prominent businessman, ensured that the programme of events was limited to discussion of the post-2015 global development agenda. There was no mention of human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009 the Sri Lankan regular army defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam – the Tamil Tigers – who were fighting a guerrilla campaign to create an independent Tamil state called Tamil Eelam in north-eastern areas of the island. As many as 100,000 people are thought to have been killed in the civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news blackout on what many NGOs considered a key concern was broken when at a meeting last Wednesday Hugo Swire, the Foreign Office minister, made a speech &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/commonwealth-peoples-forum" title=""&gt;in which he pressed Sri Lanka to investigate&lt;/a&gt; people's disappearances, guarantee freedom of expression and "stamp out intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also tweeted a picture of himself with Canada's representative Deepak Obhrai, an ethnic Tamil – the minority group who say they have been discriminated against for decades – and fellow foreign minister, who had been blocked from speaking by the Sri Lankans, fearful he would raise the issue of reconcillation. Colombo accused Obhrai of paying tribute to the Tamil rebels when he laid a wreath to victims of the island's civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result, said staff speaking anonymously, was a "campaign of intimidation and propaganda in local newspapers". Headlines claimed that&lt;a href="http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=92055" title=""&gt; "Britain flayed Sri Lanka"&lt;/a&gt; and that the meeting had been "&lt;a href="http://www.nation.lk/edition/component/k2/item/22679-commonwealth-foundation-subverts-people%E2%80%99s-forum.html" title=""&gt;subverted&lt;/a&gt;". "Staff were shouted at, trailed by police. We were blocked from doing our job. After losing control it was the last straw," said a Colombo-based source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A foundation source said some staff had left earlier than scheduled, though a foundation spokesperson said only people not required had left while the four senior and relevant staff – the director, the deputy, the chair and programme manager – remained, along with 50 civil society delegates from the Commonwealth People's Forum to attend a foreign minister's meeting on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandradasa told the Guardian there was "no bullying or anything like it". "[Swire] just made his speech. He walked off. He was texting and tweeting. But he had denigrated Sri Lanka and civil society," he said. Chandradasa claimed Swire's comments had set back progress that had been made during the summit between civic leaders and Sri Lanka's government. "We don't deny that the relationship between the civil society and Sri Lankan government is strained. But now it is worse." The Foreign Office said that the Swire speech was planned and "in line with our policy on Sri Lanka".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/commonwealth-summit"&gt;Commonwealth summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/srilanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/randeepramesh"&gt;Randeep Ramesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Time is running out to counter them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the global banking crisis in 2007, commentators across the political spectrum have confidently predicted not only the imminent collapse of the euro, but sooner or later an unavoidable implosion of the European Union itself. None of this has come to pass. But the European project, launched after the devastation of the second world war, faces the most serious threat in its history. That threat was chillingly prefigured this week by the launch of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/13/le-pen-wilders-alliance-plan-wreck-eu" title=""&gt;a pan-European alliance of far-right parties&lt;/a&gt;, led by the French National Front and the Dutch Freedom party headed by Geert Wilders, vowing to slay "the monster in Brussels".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the growth in support for far-right, anti-European, anti-immigrant parties has been fed by the worst world recession since at least the 1930s – mass unemployment and falling living standards, made worse by the self-defeating austerity obsession of European leaders. Parties that skulked in the shadows, playingdown their sympathies with fascism and Nazism are re-emerging, having given themselves a PR facelift. Marine Le Pen, leader of the French NF, plays down the antisemitic record of her party. The Dutch far-right leader has ploughed a slightly different furrow, mobilising fear and hostility not against Jews but Muslim immigrants. Like Le Pen, Wilders focuses on the alleged cosmopolitan threat to national identity from the European Union. It is a chorus echoed in other countries by the Danish People's party, the Finns party and the Flemish Vlaams Belang, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the French and Dutch populists are carefully keeping their distance from openly neo-Nazi parties such as &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/golden-dawn" title=""&gt;Golden Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, whose paramilitary &lt;em&gt;Sturmabteilung&lt;/em&gt; has terrorised refugees and immigrants in Greece, and the swaggering Hungarian &lt;em&gt;Jobbik&lt;/em&gt;, which targets the Roma minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some pollsters, the far right might win as many as a third of European parliament seats in elections next May. That would still leave the centre parties – Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Liberals – with many more members. But for the European parliament to form a credible majority, all of these parties might well be forced much closer together than is good for democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a situation would be unsettlingly reminiscent of 1936, when the centre and the left – notably in France – temporarily halted the swing to fascism but formed an unprincipled and ineffective coalition. Its collapse on the eve of the second world war accelerated the advent of Phillippe Petain's Nazi-collaborating regime. History does not normally repeat itself in an automatic fashion, but it would be foolish to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More worrying than the growth of the far right are the temporising gestures to the racists and anti-immigrants now coming from mainstream Conservative and even Liberal Democrat politicians and from some of the new "Blue Labour" ideologues. The warning from the likes of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/david-cameron-blunkett-immigration-riots" title=""&gt;David Blunkett that hostility to Roma immigrants might lead to a popular "explosion"&lt;/a&gt; is reminiscent of Enoch Powell's rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An antidote to the far right requires that the European left articulates and pursues a comprehensive alternative to economic stagnation, an ever-widening income and wealth gap and the degradation of our social standards, civil liberties and democratic rights. But that alternative has to be fought for at European as well as national and local levels, and will require more, not less, European integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is running out, not only for the&amp;nbsp;European Social Democrats, but also for the wider socialist left and the greens, to show they can create a counterbalance to the rightward drift of the centre. Without that, the new far-right alliance may only have to hold together and wait for its hour to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right"&gt;The far right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen"&gt;Marine Le Pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders"&gt;Geert Wilders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections"&gt;European elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnpalmer"&gt;John Palmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The pavement and the pillars at the front of the church are stained with spurts of junkies' blood. Disgusting doesn't really cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has to be said, my church is not a thing of beauty. The Luftwaffe did for most of the old Victorian one. And now the congregation worships in a 60s rebuild, with a solitary and entirely purposeless Victorian tower shielding the church from the main road. Looking at it, you'd never guess this parish has been in existence since the Domesday book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the 60s church building itself is not a bad piece of modernism. At least it has outlasted the massive grey blocks of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/04/bailiffs-death-knell-heygate-estate" title=""&gt;Heygate estate&lt;/a&gt; that spreads itself out on the east side of the parish. Variously described as a "mugger's paradise" and a "human dustbin" – descriptions that most residents hated (it was their home, after all) but also often agreed with – the Heygate was built just after the church, all a part of that post-war modernist optimism. But it is now being pulled down. The last resident has just been evicted. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abide_with_Me" title=""&gt;Change and decay in all around I see; O thou who changest not, abide with me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I fear that my church will end up following suit. We have just had a survey on that dreadful bloody tower – ridiculously, grade-II listed. There is £750,000 of urgent work required. When I opened the envelope and saw that figure, I just laughed out loud. Three quarters of a million quid to restore south London's most revolting public lavatory. The only good news is that the figure is so large it kills of any hope of having to try and raise it. I don't think it can be done. But even demolition (if we could ever get permission) is £350,000. And the church has nothing like that either. One day, maybe sooner rather than later, that tower is probably going to do for the&amp;nbsp;whole church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again and again, the Church of England has staked its reputation on staying in the inner city, in places such as my parish. But the combination of declining numbers and the general financial squeeze on wealthier middle-class parishes means that traditional methods of support for poorer parishes like mine – basically, having an obligatory quota system that redistributes money from wealthy parishes to poorer ones – feels less and less viable. The middle classes can no longer afford it. Or, at least, they are no longer prepared to stump up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was bishop of Durham, the current archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, introduced a more voluntary system of redistribution, with parishes deciding what they could afford to give to poorer ones. As Welby explained, with his characteristic self-deprecation: "On the basis of what is offered, the budget will be set. The risks of this are perfectly obvious. Basically, if everyone decides to pay very little there will be very little money, that is simple arithmetic and even I can handle it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is now being copied by other dioceses. Some fear it is the beginning of the end for the church in the inner-city. Given housing costs, pensions and stipend, as well as the central administrative costs of bishops etc, it costs about £60,000 a year to have a priest in a parish. My congregation doesn't even raise half of that. &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+5&amp;version=NIV" title=""&gt;Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin,&lt;/a&gt; as God's finger wrote during Belshazzar's feast.

Their contribution ranged from work in the labour movement to a female journalist breaking taboos by suing the government for harassment. They walked shoulder to shoulder with men as the Egyptian population demanded the fall of the regime, as did the people of Tunisia, Libya and Yemen. Yet nearly three years&amp;nbsp;later, &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/12/us-arab-women-idUSBRE9AB00820131112" title=""&gt;a poll &lt;/a&gt;from the Thomson Reuters Foundation has declared Egypt&amp;nbsp;the worst country for women in the Arab world. So, did the Arab spring lead to a regression of women's rights in&amp;nbsp;the region – and particularly in Egypt, as the report suggests?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egyptian women have certainly been politically marginalised in this post-revolutionary period. The male-dominated military in charge of&amp;nbsp;the transitional phase eradicated the quota for women's representation in parliament, which reduced female members from 64 to nine, and it did not include any women in the &lt;a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/take_action/discrimination_in_law_action384" title=""&gt;constitutional review committee&lt;/a&gt;. The police also&amp;nbsp;targeted female political demonstrators, going as far as stripping them naked in the street and urging molestation by thugs. They introduced &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/oct/28/virginity-test-tahrir-square" title=""&gt;virginity tests &lt;/a&gt;for women arrested during political demonstrations. The message was clear: women should go home and leave politics to the men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women's rights had been used as a velvet glove during Mubarak's regime (as with other administrations of the time, such as Ben Ali in Tunisia and Gaddafi in Libya), which passed laws to protect women while suppressing all other political rights. The elected president, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, rescinded some of these rights: restrictions on polygamy were lifted; a reduction of the marriage age was proposed; women's right to seek divorce was limited. This reflected the Brotherhood's patriarchal attitude to gender roles and family structures, and had little to do with the reality of the Egyptian economy, where women make up a large proportion of the labour force and are found in all sectors of public life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So first the military and then the Muslim Brotherhood undermined women post-revolution. This triggered a wave of anger. Many of the issues the Reuters poll refers to, such as female genital mutilation and sexual harassment, are not new. But Egyptian women – as with women in other Arab countries after the Arab spring – are more determined than ever to confront these challenges. If they stayed&amp;nbsp;silent about sexual harassment in the past, today they are writing testimonials on Facebook or creating public campaigns to confront it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, women today are no longer willing to see themselves as simply women's rights activists; they are going beyond gender or class to demand citizenship rights. This is part of a progressive discussion that was triggered in post-revolutionary Egypt and is strengthened by young people, who make up about 60% of the Arab population. The impact of impassioned, youthful voices has been seen in Saudi Arabia, too – which is ranked third worst&amp;nbsp;among Arab nations. (The comparison between Egypt and Saudi Arabia is unfair, however, as the two cultures are very different, making it difficult to evaluate both countries on similar standards.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arab spring turned women's issues into a battle in the war of ideology&amp;nbsp;between Islamists and so-called modernists. Both see women through a traditional lens and have deprived them of full participation in the political process. But women are not silent in this historical moment. They are speaking up, organising, and amassing support, not only for their rights but also for all who believe in freedom, democracy, and stability of the region at large. It is vital we hear their voices because they represent the most solid hope for the region. It is too early to be fatalistic about what is happening now. I know I still hold out hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/women"&gt;Women in politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/zeinab-salbi"&gt;Zainab Salbi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Here are my thoughts on your predicament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Jay Chapman, an American political essayist, wrote this about radicals in 1900: "They are really always saying the same thing. They don't change; everybody else changes. They are accused of the most incompatible crimes, of egoism and a mania for power, indifference to the fate of their cause, fanaticism, triviality, lack of humour, buffoonery and irreverence. But they sound a certain note. Hence the great practical power of persistent radicals. To all appearance, nobody follows them, yet everyone believes them. They hold a tuning-fork and sound A, and everybody knows it really is A, though the time-honoured pitch is G flat." Isn't this a good description of the effect of Pussy Riot performances? In spite of all accusations, you sound a certain note. It may appear that people do not follow you, but secretly, they believe you, they know you are telling the truth, or, even more, you are standing for truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is this truth? Why are the reactions to Pussy Riot performances so violent, not only in Russia? All hearts were beating for you as long as you were perceived as just another version of the liberal-democratic protest against the authoritarian state. The moment it became clear that you rejected global capitalism, reporting on Pussy Riot became much more ambiguous. What is so disturbing about Pussy Riot to the liberal gaze is that you make visible the hidden continuity between Stalinism and contemporary global capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Žižek then explores what he sees as a global trend towards limiting democracy.] Since the 2008 crisis, this distrust of democracy, once limited to third-world or post-Communist developing economies, is gaining ground in western countries. But what if this distrust is justified? What if only experts can save us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the crisis provided proof that it is these experts who don't know what they are doing, rather than the people. In western Europe, we are seeing that the ruling elite know less and less how to rule. Look at how Europe is dealing with Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder, then, that Pussy Riot make us all uneasy – you know very well what you don't know, and you don't pretend to have any quick or easy answers, but you are telling us that those in power don't know either. Your message is that in Europe today the blind are leading the blind. This is why it is so important that you persist. In the same way that Hegel, after seeing Napoleon riding through Jena, wrote that it was as if he saw the World Spirit riding on a horse, you are nothing less than the critical awareness of us all, sitting in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comradely greetings, Slavoj&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;23 February 2013&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Slavoj,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in the autumn of 2012, when I was still in the pre-trial prison in Moscow with other Pussy Riot activists, I&amp;nbsp;visited you. In a dream, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see your argument about horses, the World Spirit, and about tomfoolery and disrespect, as well as why and how all these elements are so connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pussy Riot did turn out be a part of this force, the purpose of which is criticism, creativity and co-creation, experimentation and constantly provocative events. Borrowing Nietzsche's definition, we are the children of Dionysus, sailing in a barrel and not recognising any&amp;nbsp;authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a part of this force that has no final answers or absolute truths, for our mission is to question. There are architects of apollonian statics and there are (punk) singers of dynamics and transformation. One is not better than the other. But it is only together that we can ensure the world functions in the way Heraclitus defined it: "This world has been and will eternally be living on the rhythm of fire, inflaming according to the measure, and dying away according to the measure. This is the functioning of the eternal world breath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are the rebels asking for the&amp;nbsp;storm, and believing that truth&amp;nbsp;is only to be found in an endless search. If the "World Spirit" touches you, do not expect that it&amp;nbsp;will be painless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Anderson sang: "Only an expert can deal with the problem." It would have been nice if Laurie and I could cut these experts down to size and take care of our own problems. Because expert status by&amp;nbsp;no means grants access to the kingdom of absolute truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years of prison for Pussy Riot is our tribute to a destiny that gave us sharp ears, allowing us to sound the note A when everyone else is used to hearing G flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the right moment, there will always come a miracle in the lives of those who childishly believe in the triumph of truth over lies, of mutual assistance, of those who live according to the economics of the gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nadia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 April 2013&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Nadezhda,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised when your letter arrived – the delay made me fear that the authorities would prevent our communication. I was deeply honoured, flattered even, by my appearance in your dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are right to question the idea that the "experts" close to power are competent to make decisions. Experts are, by definition, servants of those in power: they don't really think, they just apply their knowledge to the problems defined by those in power (how to bring back stability? how to squash protests?). So are today's capitalists, the so-called financial wizards, really experts? Are they not just stupid babies playing with our money and our fate? I remember a cruel joke from Ernst Lubitsch's To Be Or Not to Be. When asked about the German concentration camps in&amp;nbsp;occupied Poland, the Nazi officer snaps back: "We do the concentrating, and the Poles do the camping." Does the same not hold for the Enron bankruptcy in 2002? The thousands of employees who lost their jobs were certainly exposed to risk, but with no true choice – for them the risk was like blind fate. But those who did have insight into the risks, and the ability to intervene (the top managers), minimised their risks by cashing in their stocks before the bankruptcy. So it is true that we live in a society of risky choices, but some people (the managers) do the choosing, while others (the common people) do the risking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the true task of radical emancipatory movements is not just to shake things out of their complacent inertia, but to change the very co-ordinates of social reality so that, when things return to normal, there will be a new, more satisfying, "apollonian statics". And, even more crucially, how does today's global capitalism enter this scheme?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deleuzian philosopher Brian Massumi tells how capitalism has already overcome the logic of totalising normality and adopted the logic of erratic excess: "The more varied, and even erratic, the better. Normality starts to lose its hold. The regularities start to loosen. This loosening is part of capitalism's dynamic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I feel guilty writing this: who am I to explode in such narcissistic theoretical outbursts when you are exposed to very real deprivations? So please, if you can and want, do let me know about your situation in prison: about your daily rhythm, about the little private rituals that make it easier to survive, about how much time you have to read and write, about how other prisoners and guards treat you, about your contact with your child … true heroism resides in these seemingly small ways of organising one's life in order to survive in crazy times without losing dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With love, respect and admiration, my thoughts are with you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slavoj&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;16 April 2013&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Slavoj,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has modern capitalism really overtaken the logic of totalising norms? Or is it willing to make us believe that it has overpassed the logic of hierarchical structures and&amp;nbsp;normalisation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child I wanted to go into advertising. I had a love affair with the advertising industry. And this is why I am in a position to judge its merits. The anti-hierarchical structures and rhizomes of late capitalism are its successful ad campaign. Modern capitalism has to manifest itself as flexible and even eccentric. Everything is geared towards gripping the emotion of the consumer. Modern capitalism seeks to assure us that it operates according to the principles of free creativity, endless development and diversity. It glosses over its other side in order to hide the reality that millions of people are enslaved by an all-powerful and fantastically stable norm of production. We want to reveal this lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should not worry that you are exposing theoretical fabrications while I am supposed to suffer the "real hardship". I value the strict limits, and the challenge. I am genuinely curious: how will I cope with this? And how can I turn this into a productive experience for me and my&amp;nbsp;comrades? I find sources of&amp;nbsp;inspiration; it contributes to my own&amp;nbsp;development. Not because of, but in spite of the system. And in my&amp;nbsp;struggle, your thoughts, ideas and&amp;nbsp;stories are helpful to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy to correspond with you. I await your reply and I wish you good luck in our common cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nadia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10 June 2013&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Nadezhda,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt deeply ashamed after reading your reply. You wrote: "You should not worry about the fact that you are exposing theoretical fabrications while I am supposed to suffer the 'real hardship'." This simple sentence made me aware that the final sentiment in my last letter was false: my expression of sympathy with your plight basically meant, "I have the privilege of doing real theory and teaching you about it while you are good for reporting on your experience of hardship …" Your last letter demonstrates that you are much more than that, that you are an equal partner in a theoretical dialogue. So my sincere apologies for this proof of how deeply entrenched is male chauvinism, especially when it is masked as sympathy for the other's suffering, and let me go on with our dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the crazy dynamics of global capitalism that make effective resistance to it so difficult and frustrating. Recall the great wave of protests that spilled all over Europe in 2011, from Greece and Spain to London and Paris. Even if there was no consistent political platform mobilising the protesters, the protests functioned as part of a&amp;nbsp;large-scale educational process: the protesters' misery and discontent were transformed into a great collective act of mobilisation – hundreds of thousands gathered in public squares, proclaiming that they had enough, that things could not go on like that. However, what these protests add up to is a purely negative gesture of angry rejection and an equally abstract demand for justice, lacking the ability to translate this demand into a concrete political programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be done in such a situation, where demonstrations and protests are of no use, where democratic elections are of no use? Can we convince the tired and manipulated crowds that we are not only ready to undermine the existing order, to engage in provocative acts of resistance, but also to offer the prospect of a new order?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pussy Riot performances cannot be reduced just to subversive provocations. Beneath the dynamics of their acts, there is the inner stability of a firm ethico-political attitude. In some deeper sense, it is today's society that is caught in a crazy capitalist dynamic with no inner sense and measure, and it is Pussy Riot that de facto provides a stable ethico-political point. The very existence of Pussy Riot tells thousands that opportunist cynicism is not the only option, that we are not totally disoriented, that there still is a common cause worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I also wish you good luck in our common cause. To be faithful to our common cause means to be brave, especially now, and, as the old saying goes, luck is on the side of the brave!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours, Slavoj&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;13 July 2013&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Slavoj,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my last letter, written in haste as I worked in the sewing shop, I was not as clear as I should have been about the distinction between how "global capitalism" functions in Europe and the US on the one hand, and in Russia on the other. However, recent events in Russia – the trial of&amp;nbsp;Alexei Navalny, the passing of unconstitutional, anti-freedom laws&amp;nbsp;– have infuriated me. I feel compelled to speak about the specific political and economic practices of my country. The last time I felt this angry was in 2011 when Putin declared he was running for the presidency for a third time. My anger&amp;nbsp;and resolve led to the birth of&amp;nbsp;Pussy Riot. What will happen now? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in Russia I have a strong sense of the cynicism of so-called first-world countries towards poorer nations. In my humble opinion, "developed" countries display an exaggerated loyalty towards governments that oppress their citizens and violate their rights. The European and US governments freely collaborate with Russia as it imposes laws from the middle ages and throws opposition politicians in jail. They collaborate with China, where oppression is so bad that my hair stands on end just to think about it. What are the limits of tolerance? And when does tolerance become collaboration, conformism and complicity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To think, cynically, "let them do&amp;nbsp;what they want in their own country", doesn't work any longer, because Russia and China and countries like them are now part of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;global capitalist system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia under Putin, with its dependence on raw materials, would have been massively weakened if those nations that import Russian oil and gas had shown the courage of their convictions and stopped buying. Even if Europe were to take&amp;nbsp;as modest a step as passing a "Magnitsky law" [the Magnitsky Act in the US allows it to place sanctions on Russian officials believed to have taken part in human-rights violations], morally it would speak volumes. A boycott of the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 would be another ethical gesture. But the continued trade in raw materials constitutes a tacit approval of the Russian regime – not through words, but through money. It betrays the desire to protect the political and economic status quo and the division of labour that lies at the heart of the world economic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You quote Marx: "A social system that seizes up and rusts … cannot survive." But here I am, working out my prison sentence in a country where the 10 people who control the&amp;nbsp;biggest sectors of the economy are Vladimir Putin's oldest friends. He studied or played sports with some, and served in the KGB with others. Isn't this a social system that&amp;nbsp;has seized up? Isn't this a feudal&amp;nbsp;system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thank you sincerely, Slavoj, for our correspondence and can hardly wait for your reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours, Nadia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• The correspondence was organised by Philosophie magazine in cooperation with New Times.

But geography, history and chance have combined to give it a disproportionate importance in world affairs. Over the years, it has risen to the challenge of its role by producing politicians of a stature to hold their own among representatives of much bigger and stronger countries. Glafcos Clerides, who has died aged 94, was the outstanding example – a local nationalist who, at an comparatively early stage in his political career, won the right to be considered a statesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it was his ability to see clearly the bigger issues that was his tragedy. He grasped – more than a decade before the majority of his fellow Greek Cypriots – the true implications of Turkey's invasion of the island in 1974. But he was unable to convert the electorate to his view that half a loaf was better than none, and paid for his beliefs with a long stretch in the political wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the Turkish Cypriots' subsequent refusal to accept what he regarded as manifestly reasonable proposals turned Clerides from a conciliator into a rejectionist. His two terms as president, from 1993 until 2003, will be remembered as a period of fruitless dialogue and increased tensions between the two communities. But it was also during Clerides's presidency that the negotiations for Cyprus to join the European Union were completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clerides was born in Nicosia, the son of a distinguished barrister, and went on to become a lawyer himself. But before starting his career, he served in the RAF during the second world war. His bomber was shot down over Hamburg in 1942 and he spent the rest of the conflict as a prisoner of war. It was as a law student in London after the war that he met and married his Indian-born wife, Lila, who was then working for the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1951, not long after the birth of their only child, Katy, Clerides returned to Cyprus to practise law. He always denied being a member of the Eoka guerrilla movement, but was active in the independence struggle (a slight misnomer in the case of the Greek Cypriots, most of whom actually wanted union or enosis with Greece).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time independence was in sight, Clerides's credentials both as a lawyer and as a nationalist were sufficiently well-established for him to be appointed justice minister in the transitional period from British colonial rule. In July 1960, he was elected to the House of Representatives and served as its president or speaker until 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The years following independence saw the collapse into violence of the dream of a Cyprus in which Greeks and Turks could co-exist under a complex set of power-sharing arrangements. By 1968, the two communities were deeply divided on a wide range of constitutional issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May that year, Clerides was asked by President Makarios to represent the Greek Cypriot side in what was to be the first of many rounds of talks with the then Turkish Cypriot number two, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/15/rauf-denktash-obituary" title=""&gt;Rauf Denktash&lt;/a&gt;. The two men had been law students together in London, and throughout their lengthy and tortuous dealings they retained an affectionate, if wary, respect for one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were obvious similarities between them. They were both rotund, genial and engagingly wily. But despite the hopes repeatedly attached to it, the long-running Clerides and Denktash show never delivered peace, and it has been argued that it was a mistake for each side to have put up such an able lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other view, not necessarily incompatible, is that Clerides was repeatedly held back from a compromise by Makarios. Certainly, by the end of the first set of talks, which dragged on until 1974, Clerides would have been willing to accept local autonomy, which at that time was the Turkish Cypriots' principal demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months after the talks collapsed, disaster struck. The Greek National Guard on the island, backed by the junta in Athens, staged a coup with the totally unrealistic aim of forcing enosis. A former Eoka gunman, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/21/guardianobituaries1" title=""&gt;Nicos Sampson&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed president and Turkey invaded to prevent what many Turks and Turkish Cypriots feared would be a bloodbath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampson resigned three days after the Turkish troops landed, and Clerides was made acting president. A further round of talks with Denktash, by then the leader of his community, in Geneva failed to prevent the Turkish forces from renewing their offensive and seizing the whole of the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Makarios's return, Clerides resumed his role as speaker of the house and negotiator in chief. He talked with Denktash in Vienna in January 1975, in New York in September 1975 and later Cyprus itself. But all to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clerides himself became convinced that the Greek Cypriots could never get back more than a part of the north and he was ready to compromise on the Turkish Cypriots' demands for a bi-zonal solution, in return for the cession of territory. Few others in the south wanted to face up to the ugly reality, though, and Makarios never felt able or willing to give Clerides the backing he needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 1976, Clerides resigned in despair from his post as negotiator. Politically, his departure cost him dear. At the elections in the Greek Cypriot area that year, his recently founded Democratic Rally party (DISY) failed to win a single seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of Makarios in 1977 and his replacement by &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/14/guardianobituaries.cyprus" title=""&gt;Spyros Kyprianou&lt;/a&gt; marked the start of a period in which the Greek Cypriot side gradually hardened its position. Clerides's political fortunes improved at the 1981 general election when his right-wing party took 12 of the 35 Greek Cypriot seats in the House of Representatives. But he failed to wrest the presidency from Kyprianou two years later and, when Kyprianou's grip on power was finally loosened in 1988, it was the communist-backed millionaire Georghios Vassiliou, and not Clerides, who replaced him as head of state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vassiliou's victory represented a defeat for the fruitless, hardline attitudes of the Kyprianou era. It marked a return to sort of the flexibility that had characterised Clerides's approach in the mid-70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the time he entered his second presidential campaign, Clerides himself had changed. He now, for example, favoured an increase in Greece's military presence as a way of strengthening the Greek Cypriots' bargaining position and forcing a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he entered his third presidential campaign, in 1993, it was as the hardline challenger. His victory, by a margin of just 0.6 per cent of the vote, was greeted with misgivings by many international diplomats who would have been overjoyed to see him as head of state a decade and a half earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the Turks and Turkish Cypriots also now represented vastly more intransigent positions – to the extent of being censured by the UN secretary general for their obstructiveness – it may be wondered whether the shades of dissimilarity in Clerides's position made a jot of difference. At all events, his presidency did not bring the island any nearer a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, there were only the most desultory of inter-communal talks, and more than one clash between Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish forces. In 1996, two demonstrators were killed within a few days of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the tensions between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus soared. Yet, somehow, throughout it all, Clerides and Denktash managed to keep intact their mutual respect and a wicked, shared sense of humour. The Cyprus Mail recalled that in 2003, when his eternal sparring partner was in hospital after a serious operation, Clerides rang him up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked Denktash how he was and the Turkish Cypriot leader said "Glafcos, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy", to which Clerides replied "thank you, Rauf".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clerides's wife died in 2007. He is survived by his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Glafcos Clerides, politician, born 24 April 1919; died 15 November 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnhooper"&gt;John Hooper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Previous efforts in Haiti, Japan and elsewhere point the way, but how can we build back better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: there are people to rescue, mouths to feed. Medical supplies to distribute, bodies to bury, law and order to reinstate. But what next? When the immediate threat from Typhoon Haiyan has passed and the rains have stopped, when the suddenly homeless of Tacloban take stock and regard the obliterated ruins of their city, where do you start? How do you rebuild a city?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of recent precedents: Port-au-Prince following the 2010 earthquake, the towns of northeastern Japan following Fukushima a year later. The tsunami cities of southeast Asia, New York after Hurricane Sandy, New Orleans. But the lessons are&amp;nbsp;sobering. There is no quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms make a mess. After the 2010 quake in Haiti, there were 19m cubic metres of debris in Port-au-Prince, a&amp;nbsp;quantity that could have filled a&amp;nbsp;line of containers all the way from London to Beirut. The 2011 Fukushima tsunami created 25m tonnes of rubble and wreckage. The first daunting task: what&amp;nbsp;to do with it all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese authorities were praised&amp;nbsp;for quickly &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2011/mar/14/rikuzentakata-after-tsunami-iwate-japan"&gt;clearing destroyed coastal towns like Rikuzentakata&lt;/a&gt;. These days, neat piles of debris and rubbish stand on the outskirts of levelled towns that the passage of time has turned into empty fields overgrown with grass and weeds. The waves themselves did their bit, too: as much as one fifth of the wreckage was washed out to sea. Some of it even turned up on the other side of&amp;nbsp;the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Port-au-Prince, international agencies such as the UN and USAid financed removal programmes with excavation equipment, as well as on a&amp;nbsp;smaller scale, with neighbourhood teams working on specific plot of lands. But it's not a process that is done overnight. Just clearing Tacloban of the ruins will take months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say that the first priority is to clear roads and other transport connections. Access to all places is crucial. And not everything should be thrown away. Some of the wreckage will be reusable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a survey of the disaster-hit buildings, there needs to be a reconstruction strategy. Perhaps the first question is this: are you going to just revive the city on the devastated site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 2004 tsunami, for example, the Sri Lankan authorities considered relocating the city of Galle inland. "The government had thought of a&amp;nbsp;buffer zone along the coast of about 200 metres," says Jan Meeuwissen of UN-Habitat, who worked in the region after the tsunami, "but you can't move a&amp;nbsp;city inland that easily." The plans were shelved. Galle was restored on its original site. But Meeuwissen adds: "You can't say that in general you can build specifically where a city was before. Sometimes it's not relevant to build back in the same place if the place is prone to floods, or on a slope that would expose it to other risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, communities along the wrecked Fukushima coast are still debating whether to rebuild inland, which would require levelling mountains to free up land for housing, or construction of huge and expensive, sea walls to keep out any future tsunami. In Banda Aceh, decimated by the 2004 tsunami, some of the 140,000 houses rebuilt were done so on higher ground. New Orleans, unfortunately, is not so moveable. So ever since the 2005 Katrina storm that killed 1,400 and flooded 80% of the city, much of the effort has focused on making the city more viable in the face of the perennial threat from the other side of the levees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The physical barriers that are in place are much more robust," said John J Kiefer, director of the University of New Orleans' master of public administration program, who specialises in disaster research. "The mechanisms to inspect those physical mechanisms such as the levies are now much more professional than they were."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2009/dec/23/banda-aceh-tsunami-indonesia"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the residents of Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;, there was a different imperative: ensuring that inhabitants would stand a chance if there was a repeat disaster. "There are roads built to escape," said Satya Tripathi, former UN recovery coordinator for Aceh. "Everytime an earthquake alert is set off, evacuation of the population is very orderly. A safe way out has become part of the living space." The realisation in the city was this: that in the face of a tsunami, the city cannot be saved. But people can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more resourceful survivors may to try to rebuild their homes immediately, or at least repair shelter temporarily. Yet unfortunately there are no quick fixes. Reconstruction is not just about the four walls of your own home; there is the wider social infrastructure – access to water and sanitation, electricity, supply chains, roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practitioners say it is crucial to "build back better", to mitigate the impact of future disasters. Good governance is vital. If the authorities thought of the possible disaster scenarios in advance, they are more likely to achieve a better outcome in the face of a real one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high density of urban areas can be problematic. "In many urban situations the occupancy rates of multi-storey buildings are very high and there may be a high percentage of renters, as in Haiti," says Sandra D'Urzo, shelter officer at the International Federation of Red Cross. "The collapse of the building creates problems of ownership, access and temporary re-housing. Who owns the rubble? Who should remove it? What to do with slabs of concrete? Do renters move elsewhere and rent&amp;nbsp;again?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before reconstruction begins, the local authorities and the agencies need to assess the conditions of the buildings after a disaster. It is crucial to see which buildings can be repaired and which cannot, explained Robin Cross, CEO of&amp;nbsp;Article 25, a charity that works on reconstruction in disaster-hit areas and&amp;nbsp;has rebuilt schools in Haiti. After conducting assessments on around 20 buildings, Article 25 rebuilt nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are always trying to build back better so that buildings are more resistant and communities more resilient to the threats," Cross said. Authorities also usually decide about "no-build" areas, which will have an impact on the longer term solution they are seeking to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again, it's a slow process. Thousands of Japanese have still yet to be rehoused after Fukushima. In Haiti, there are still around 300,000 people living in temporary shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In all the recreation of urban space after a disaster there is a potential mistake: because people have immediate need for shelter, you establish post-disaster camps at the edge of a city," says Paul Knox-Clarke, head of research at the ALNAP international humanitarian group. "The problem is that those settlements become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is bureaucracy. In Japan, more than two years after the earthquake and tsunami hit, the Fukushima prefecture is still grappling with radiation cleanup and recovery. This week Japanese officials admitted that thousands may never be able to return home. Earlier this year, the mayor of Kamauchi, a town in the prefecture, told the Guardian that the village's future was in doubt and there had been considerable delays in cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main obstacle to swift reconstruction is not financial – the administration of Shinzo¯ Abe has raised the reconstruction budget to 25tn yen over five years. It is red tape. Progress in&amp;nbsp;towns such as Rikuzentakata, where 1,800 people died out of a population of&amp;nbsp;24,000, is being held up by Japan's infamous bureaucracy and disagreement among residents over where to rebuild their homes, schools, hospitals and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/mar/13/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-japan"&gt;About 5,000 of Rikuzentakata's survivors live in temporary housing&lt;/a&gt; units built on higher land, while others have moved to towns and cities inland. Construction of new residential areas began in April, more than two years after the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town's mayor, Futoshi Toba, whose wife, Kumi, died in the tsunami, has been a vocal critic of the red tape and inaction by politicians in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reconstruction isn't going well at all," Toba said earlier this year. "We are still surrounded by mountains of rubble, and the few buildings that survived the tsunami have been left standing. The survivors share my view that there is little hope for the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toba added: "I have come up against that vertical thinking time and again over the past two years. Politicians here say they stand with us, but their words are not being matched by actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding a city is not just a physical process; it's also psychological. And that is why, according to Meeuwissen, it&amp;nbsp;is vital to include locals. "They call it the people's process," he says. "It's extremely important to involve people affected by the disasters. Identifying what their needs are and involving them&amp;nbsp;in the reconstruction process. The&amp;nbsp;people who experienced a disaster have a capacity to build back: it is not just about physically rebuilding communities, but also rebuilding them&amp;nbsp;psychologically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charities such as Article 25 agree, and talk to residents about what they want for their communities in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John McAslan, the architect behind the refurbishment of King's Cross Station in London, has a special relationship with the city of Port-au-Prince. He had visited several times before the earthquake, and in 2010 worked to restore the city's Iron Market,&amp;nbsp;built in 1891. The market was&amp;nbsp;the heart of commercial life&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;Haitian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site had been damaged by a fire&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;2008, and it collapsed after the 2010 quake, killing a number of people. For nine months, McAslan's practice worked with 700 local constructors – bricklayers, artisans and metalwork specialists – to bring the market back to&amp;nbsp;life. "The Iron Market, along with the cathedral and the citadel, is a symbol of&amp;nbsp;the country, so it was incredibly important and more than just a building," McAslan said. The project was finished in January 2011, almost a&amp;nbsp;year after the quake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics from the UN show that for the first time in history, there are more humans living in cities than in the countryside, and the rate is likely to&amp;nbsp;increase. With extreme weather becoming more common, issues of reconstruction after natural disasters are crucial for the future of cities and how they adapt. There is a perception that in Haiti it was not the earthquake that killed people, but the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Building back better" may become a&amp;nbsp;mantra for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Justin McCurry in Tokyo and Adam Gabbatt in New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/typhoon-haiyan"&gt;Typhoon Haiyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters"&gt;Natural disasters and extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima"&gt;Fukushima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower"&gt;Nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami"&gt;Japan disaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He had just performed a U-turn in his Renault Laguna on the A28 near Tenterden when he failed to return to the correct side of the carriageway. His vehicle collided head-on with a Skoda Fabia driven by David Crane, 62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British father of two, from Rolvenden in Kent, was on his way home from work at 11.30pm. He suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crane, the court was heard, had been a charity fundraiser and "a very good man" who cared for his disabled wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was first heard at Canterbury crown court in July, when Fleury was acquitted of causing death by dangerous driving but convicted of causing death by careless driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was jailed for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the criminal appeal court in London on Friday, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, Mr Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Green reduced the sentence to nine months. Fleury is expected to be freed next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court was told that the Frenchman was on his way to visit his English girlfriend, Emily Crick, in Wadhurst, East Sussex, having travelled from France through the Channel tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been awake for 16 hours and had been driving for six and a half hours when the crash occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers argued there was "no evidence" that he had been tired: he had taken a nap on the shuttle as it passed through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Justice Irwin expressed his sympathy for Mr Crane's family, saying: "He was a very good and loving father to two daughters, and a husband who looked after his disabled partner. They are all terribly distraught about their loss. It is clear that he was a good man and his death has caused great loss and pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added, Fleury was less blameworthy for his fatal "mistake" because he is French. "This young man made a mistake at the end of his journey," the judge explained. "As a Frenchman, used to driving on the right hand side of the road, he remained on the right hand side of the road after his U-turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did a U-turn in the dark in England and, for moments or minutes, forgot that he was not driving in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The culpability of a British driver in the same circumstances would have been very high indeed. For somebody from France, the culpability must be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A starting point of two years, before allowing discount for his guilty plea, was too high. The starting point ought to have been 12 months, with the resulting sentence being one of nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We therefore reduce the sentence of 18 months to one of nine months and, to that extent, this appeal is allowed," the judge concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/court-of-appeal"&gt;Court of appeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/road-safety"&gt;Road safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/road-transport"&gt;Road transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring"&gt;Motoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owenbowcott"&gt;Owen Bowcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

hunt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An American TV presenter has been condemned for tweeting a picture of herself standing over a dead lion and boasting that she hunted it on safari in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 3,500 people signed an online petition calling for the self-declared "hardcore hunter" Melissa Bachman to be banned from returning to South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota-based celebrity posted a photo of herself smiling next to the body of an adult lion after a hunt at the &lt;a href="http://www.maroiconservancy.co.za" title=""&gt;Maroi conservancy&lt;/a&gt; in the northern Limpopo province. The caption read: "An incredible day hunting in South Africa! Stalked inside 60 yards on this beautiful male lion … what a hunt!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The style is a familiar one for Bachman, who has previously been photographed with &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/natgeo-television-keep-melissa-bachman-on-alaska-survival-sign-this-petition-to-show-your-support-to-the-great-sport-of-hunting" title=""&gt;what appears to be the carcass of a bear&lt;/a&gt;. She is no stranger controversy, having been removed as a contestant on the National Geographic show Ultimate Survival Alaska last year after more than 13,000 people signed a petition criticising the inclusion of the "heartless trophy hunter".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her lion tweet has provoked another angry backlash. One Twitter user, Gaye Davis, asked: "If it was beautiful why kill it?" Tim Flack, a South African, commented: "People like @MelissaBachman hunting lion in SA is everything that's wrong with our hunting industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A petition on &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/the-government-of-the-republic-of-south-africa-deny-future-entry-to-melissa-bachman" title=""&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt; urges the South African government to bar Bachman from the country. It says: "Melissa Bachman has made a career out of hunting wildlife for pure sport. She is an absolute contradiction to the culture of conservation, this country prides itself on. Her latest Facebook post features her with a lion she has just executed and murdered in our country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of hunting in South Africa argue that it raises funds from wealthy tourists which are then ploughed back into conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lourens Mostert, game farm manager at the Maroi conservancy, confirmed that a lion was killed and said the hunt was legal. "If it isn't right to hunt these lions, why does out government legally give us permission?" he told the Times newspaper. "This is not the only lion that has been hunted in South Africa this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrage of criticism prompted Bachman to make her Twitter account private. Her personal bio reads: "I've been an avid hunter my entire life &amp; now I've turned my passion into a career as a TV producer, host and writer. I'm a hardcore hunter doing what I love!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith"&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

For Simon Russell Beale it provided guidance and comfort in a hostile world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am now a little over 50 years old. During that half century, life for gay men in Britain has changed in ways that I could never have foreseen as a young man. I grew up in a world where the idea of love between two men was, at best, tolerated. For most of the time the subject was ignored. Since then, despite predictable and poisonous outbreaks of homophobia, the courage of activists has ensured that the age of consent is now the same as that for heterosexuals, discrimination in the workplace is outlawed and civil partnerships – more&amp;nbsp;popular than anticipated – are an unexceptional part of our lives. Gay men now stand very nearly equal with their heterosexual brothers before the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gay politics and the tortuous fight for dignity and equality are inextricably linked in my mind to my first reading of &lt;a href="http://www.iyicreative.com/maryrenaultsociety/who-is-mary-renault.asp" title=""&gt;Mary Renault&lt;/a&gt;. This, I hope, would have pleased her; because, in her quiet way, she played a heroic part in that fight. I arrived to live in London a sheltered, possibly even privileged, young man and, to be frank, the first years were hard. I had little money, I was unsure what career I wanted to pursue and the city, which I have since grown to love, seemed confusing and intimidating. I had long known that I was gay, a fact that didn't seem to bother my family or my friends, something for which I will always be grateful. Although I knew that I was loved I felt unsteady, and this unsteadiness was about to be exacerbated by something that I and so&amp;nbsp;many others could never have anticipated, the arrival and devastating impact of Aids. I remember a friend running into the sitting room of my flat one evening and shakily asking whether I had heard about a new disease that was killing gay men. That is how Aids became defined in the popular consciousness, as a curse with some curious moral agenda: the "gay plague". Faced with the deaths of so many, the only viable and bravest reaction available to the gay community was defiance, a reassertion of their pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during this time of insecurity, of fear even, when so much physical and psychological damage was done and when so much needed to&amp;nbsp;change, that I picked up my first Mary Renault novel, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099463474/fire-from-heaven" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire From Heaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Renault's telling of the story of Alexander the Great bewitched me. I&amp;nbsp;fell in love with the central character and within months had read all I could&amp;nbsp;find about him. Yet Alexander remained in my mind as Renault had drawn him: he was fabulously good-looking, golden-haired, bright-eyed, quite literally smelling of roses, fearsomely honourable and capable of&amp;nbsp;deep, unwavering love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as I fell under this spell, I knew Renault's portrait was, in large part, fabricated. The cruelties of Alexander's world and the megalomania of the man himself were swept aside, as Renault intended they should be, by a vision of light, heat and physical and spiritual beauty. But there was something of value in this attempt to extract what was pure and fine in classical culture. At a simple, visceral level the picture of handsome men falling in love without guilt or shame was the perfect antidote to life in a city traumatised by the arrival of a hideous disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renault wrote three novels about Alexander the Great and he appears as a shining hope in the final pages of a fourth, &lt;em&gt;The Mask of Apollo&lt;/em&gt;. Recreating the ancient world allows Renault the freedom to portray homosexual love as&amp;nbsp;part of the unquestioned order of things, a possibility without judgmental baggage. In contrast, &lt;em&gt;The Charioteer&lt;/em&gt;, a novel set during the second world war, presents us with a more unsettling read. Renault cannot avoid confronting the prejudices that any gay man must have encountered during the war years, although she clings magnificently to her vision of a strong, ideal love. Compared to the lighter style of the Alexander trilogy, the language of &lt;em&gt;The Charioteer&lt;/em&gt; can seem convoluted as the writer negotiates her way through the psychological intricacies of the protagonist's development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intricacy, the care taken, is unsurprising if we consider the world in which Renault was working – that sombre, twilit world of the early 1950s, when so much of homosexual life was threaded through with fear of exposure. It is a small miracle that Renault, described by her biographer Michael Sweetman as a "bookish, suburban girl", should write such an explosive and courageous book and this may be indicative that, perhaps as a result of a catastrophic world war, attitudes were beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that this change was easy to spot. Renault's American publishers refused to bring out the novel for fear of prosecution and in 1953, the year in which &lt;em&gt;The Charioteer&lt;/em&gt; appeared in Britain, President Eisenhower's administration barred homosexuals from federal posts, the link between perceived sexual deviance and treason being an important focus for a new, paranoid orthodoxy. There were worries, too, about the reaction of Renault's readership. She hadn't brought out anything for five years and this story – her first to&amp;nbsp;follow directly the fortunes of&amp;nbsp;gay men – would likely have taken them by surprise. As it happened, these worries were groundless. Indeed, the sympathetic portrayal of homosexual men proved a winning formula and it was one that Renault would use again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in other stories about a young man's sentimental education, the reader is asked to bear witness to the pursuit and definition of an individual, workable moral code. But this cannot be done without acknowledging, however delicately, the opinions of a wider world. There are plenty of sharply written portraits – a proselytising old lady, the hero Laurie's pompous new stepfather – that give some indication as to how others may see and judge homosexuality. There is also a sad and uncomfortable scene where Laurie comforts a young boy and is suddenly acutely aware that his actions may be misinterpreted – a situation that rings true for many men today. Despite Renault's writing one particularly fine speech of passionate justification, there are moments when she allows Laurie to reveal himself to be, if not prejudiced, then at least censorious. Even though the legal implications of a homosexual life are barely mentioned, the careful writing and the opaque nature of some of the arguments are symptomatic of a degree of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most memorable display of unease is when Laurie analyses his fellow guests, all gay men, at a clandestine party: "They were specialists. They had not merely accepted their limitations, as Laurie was ready to accept his … They had identified themselves with their limitations; they were making a career of them. They had turned from all other reality and curled up in them snugly, as in a womb."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may or may not refer specifically to homosexuality, but it is a passage that rings with the harsh certainty of youth. Like many gay men Laurie dislikes the idea of being defined principally by his sexuality. For him, being classified as "queer" is not liberating but restrictive. As he says, it's about "shutting you away, somehow; roping you off with a lot of people you don't feel much in common with". He needs to find his own way. As Laurie puts it, he wants to be "loyal to his humanity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, many of the men whom Laurie meets at the party – one of the central set-pieces of the novel – are unattractive. This quality is exacerbated by their high theatrical mode of speech, including infantilising nicknames, and conversation that is necessarily coded and often arch. There is also an attempted suicide, a crude and manipulative grab for attention, which could be interpreted by an unsympathetic reader as a wearying reassertion that gay men are unhappy. What saves the party, for us and for Laurie, is the arrival of Ralph Lanyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralph is, at first glance, another Alexander – or at least that is how Laurie sees him. He has the same fair hair, piercing eyes and athletic physique. When we first meet them together, at school, classical associations are already a fundamental part of their emotional vocabulary. Talking to Ralph, Laurie becomes dizzy with the possibility of experiencing what he has only read about: "He was lifted into a kind of exalted dream, part loyalty, part hero-worship, all romance. Half-remembered images moved in it, the tents of Troy, the columns of Athens, David waiting in an olive grove for the sound of Jonathan's bow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Ralph is Alexander, then he is an Alexander darkened and hardened by the realities of war. Even at school, there is a hint of something less than ideal: in Renault's tart description, the 19-year-old Ralph has "the bleak courage of the self-disciplined neurotic". There seems little compensating glory in Ralph's life. It is no accident that Renault sets her story in the aftermath of the heroic scramble of Dunkirk, or that we spend much of&amp;nbsp;our time with Laurie in a hospital ward, a world Renault knew well. She&amp;nbsp;had been a nurse herself and had tended soldiers evacuated from France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the aftermath of war, dreary and painful. Despite the appearance of conscientious objectors as hospital orderlies there is precious little talk of heroism or even moral justification. The time Laurie spends in hospital is time spent in acknowledging and accepting hurt. In&amp;nbsp;one marvellous passage, Renault writes: "With a poignancy he had never felt during the half-stupefying agony on the beach, he was beset by a terrible consciousness of the world's ever-renewed, ever-varied, never-dying pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is Ralph, wounded, but still possessed of a steely, private self-discipline, who transforms Laurie's half-drugged, unfocused life. He teaches Laurie about the response to pain and imperfection, the ever-shifting pattern of regret, compassion and forgiveness. It is through the force of his will that he not only opens Laurie's eyes to the muddied world around him but also to the inevitable progress of their mutual love. After all, Laurie spends most of the book in love with someone else, and whether he and Andrew, one of the orderlies and a gentle soul, are a match for Ralph's single-mindedness is a question that provides the central thrust of the story. We can only hope that emotional upheaval will lead to a peaceful resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before he leaves school, Ralph hands Laurie a book, Plato's &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;. Laurie keeps it close during the war and the book, now battered and bloodied, is with him in hospital. It features a charioteer who drives an unstable team of two horses – one black and scruffy, the other fine and white – and this image of conflict and possible resolution resonates in Laurie's mind throughout his story. At&amp;nbsp;the time of his giving &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt; to Laurie, Ralph dismisses it as "just a nice idea" and warns him that it might "give him illusions". This is disingenuous, or&amp;nbsp;perhaps, since the emotional temperature is high at this point, Ralph is avoiding inappropriate intimacy. The fact is that works of classical culture have always been more than "a nice idea", and for gay men of a certain period, class and education they had a particular significance. They provided guidance and comfort in an essentially hostile world, and this book is a testament to that. It is, in its way, a historical gay document. Writing within an intellectual and emotional landscape, the details of which are now fading, Renault wrote a powerful memorial to those gay men for whom the study of classical literature was an essential means to an examined and happy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Renault's &lt;em&gt;The Charioteer&lt;/em&gt; has just been reissued by Virago.

width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Special rapporteur on freedom of expression says he is alarmed at political response to revelations of mass surveillance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior United Nations official responsible for freedom of expression has warned that the British government's response to the mass surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden is doing serious damage to the UK's international reputation for investigative journalism and press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx" title=""&gt;Frank La Rue&lt;/a&gt;, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, said he was alarmed at the political reaction &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files" title=""&gt;following the revelations about the extent and reach&lt;/a&gt; of secret surveillance programmes run by Britain's eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have been absolutely shocked about the way the Guardian has been treated, from &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/edward-snowden-guardian-should-be-prosecuted-tory-mp" title=""&gt;the idea of prosecution&lt;/a&gt; to the fact that some &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/nsa-files-mps-debate-oversight-of-the-intelligence-services" title=""&gt;members of parliament even called it treason&lt;/a&gt;," said La Rue. "I think that is unacceptable in a democratic society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Rue's intervention comes as a delegation of the world's leading editors and publishers prepares for a "press freedom mission" to the UK to raise their own concerns about the British government's position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organised by &lt;a href="http://www.wan-ifra.org/press-releases/2013/11/08/international-delegation-uk-press-freedom-mission" title=""&gt;the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA), the delegation will arrive in January&lt;/a&gt; and include publishers and editors from five continents. WAN-IFRA says the mission is the first of its kind to the UK and has been prompted by growing concerns about UK government interference in press regulation and the political pressure on the Guardian. The delegation is expected to meet government and opposition leaders, press industry figures and civil society organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned that these actions not only seriously damage the United Kingdom's historic international reputation as a staunch defender of press freedom, but provide encouragement to non-democratic regimes to justify their own repressive actions," said Vincent Peyrègne, chief executive of the Paris-based WAN-IFRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian, and major media organisations in other countries, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, began disclosing details of the extent and reach of secret surveillance programmes run by GCHQ and the NSA in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles have sparked a global debate on the scale and oversight of surveillance by the US and UK intelligence agencies. However, in the UK there has been growing political pressure on the Guardian, with calls for it to be prosecuted, a decision to call the editor, Alan Rusbridger, to give evidence to the home affairs select committee and a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/david-cameron-nsa-threat-newspapers-guardian-snowden" title=""&gt;warning from David Cameron that he would take "tougher measures"&lt;/a&gt; against the newspaper unless it demonstrated "some social responsibility".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday the New York Times voiced its concern over the political climate in the UK. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/opinion/british-press-freedom-under-threat.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0" title=""&gt;In an editorial entitled "British press freedom under threat"&lt;/a&gt; it stated: "Britain has a long tradition of a free, inquisitive press. That freedom, so essential to democratic accountability, is being challenged by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of Prime Minister David Cameron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It pointed out that unlike the US, Britain has no constitutional guarantee of press freedom. "Parliamentary committees and the police are now exploiting that lack of protection to harass, intimidate and possibly prosecute the Guardian newspaper for its publication of information based on National Security Agency documents that were leaked by Edward Snowden … The global debate now taking place about intelligence agencies collecting information on the phone calls, emails and internet use of private citizens owes much to the Guardian's intrepid journalism. In a free society, the price for printing uncomfortable truths should not be parliamentary and criminal inquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Guardian La Rue said the political fallout in the UK was unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you are in public office you understand that the role of the press is to investigate things that are done right or things that are done wrong and make it known to the public. And if you are in office you know that you come under public scrutiny and public scrutiny comes with public criticism and you cannot use national security as an argument and much less challenge as treason something that is informing the public, even if it is embarrassing information for those that are in office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/press-freedom"&gt;Press freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/freedom-of-speech"&gt;Freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/national-newspapers"&gt;National newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden"&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq"&gt;GCHQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewtaylor"&gt;Matthew Taylor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nickhopkins"&gt;Nick Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/philmaynard"&gt;Phil Maynard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

These together with moves in the pipeline in Britain should provide major improvements in patient safety, the &lt;a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org" title=""&gt;General Medical Council (GMC)&lt;/a&gt; said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said the changes would "close a serious gap in our regulatory defences". The government and GMC are already planning to change British law next year to allow regulators to test EU doctors already working in the UK when concerns have been raised about their English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although EU doctors will still be allowed to automatically join the UK professional register, the GMC can withhold the licence to practise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as the new rules ensuring doctors can speak the language of the member state in which they are working, EU ministers approved a compulsory alert system requiring health regulators to tell their counterparts across the union when a doctor or health worker has been removed from their professional register or had working restrictions placed on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This too was welcomed by Dickson: "If we are to protect patients, free movement of professionals must be accompanied by free movement of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pan-European changes represent a victory for the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/may/04/german-doctor-patient-overdose" title=""&gt;family of David Gray, who died in Cambridgeshire in 2008 after being given a 10-fold overdose of a painkiller by German doctor Daniel Ubani on his first shift in Britain.&lt;/a&gt; Two of his sons, Rory, a satellite engineer who works in Germany, and Stuart, a GP in the Midlands, campaigned relentlessly to highlight Britain's failures in monitoring out-of-hours care and checks on the competence of doctors from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They and the Guardian exposed failures in vetting EU and other European doctors seeking work in Britain, including less rigorous procedures than those for doctors from other parts of the world. Ministers will now hope the UK has a sufficiently robust system of checks from registration, to licence to practise to employment. More than 200 senior doctors in NHS commissioning groups in England are now legally responsible for checking the communication skills of doctors before offering jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GMC has long campaigned for wider powers although the detail of translating a new EU directive into British law depends on the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 27,000 European doctors are on the UK medical register, more than a tenth of the total. However changes for nurses might be more problematic The Nursing and Midwifery Council has a professional register - on which there are nearly 19,000 European nurses - but this essentially just recognises qualifications. It has no equivalent of a licence to practise although it says employers should routinely check language skills. Nursing regulators are already in talks with the Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/doctors"&gt;Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nursing"&gt;Nursing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We look at the movies that proved censors didn't know their Rs from their elbows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Weinstein &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/13/philomena-judi-dench-steve-coogan-rating" title=""&gt;enlisted Dame Judi Dench to revive her role as M in Bond this week&lt;/a&gt; in a spoof video that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/14/philomena-weinstein-wins-ratings-appeal-steve-coogan" title=""&gt;convinced the Motion Picture Association of America to downgrade Philomena's R rating&lt;/a&gt; to the less restrictive PG-13. The MPAA turned a blind eye to one "fuck", as two would normally make Stephen Frears's film unfit for teen viewing. Film ratings, as can be seen from the following, are often strange and unaccountable creatures...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137858/king-s-speech" title=""&gt;The King's Speech&lt;/a&gt; (2010)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Weinstein is no stranger to lobbying film boards for classification downgrades. He and director Tom Hooper did much the same thing in relation to The King's Speech when the British Board of Film Classification certified it a 15. He argued that the general heartwarmingness of the film countered the multiple instances of "fuck". Eventually the BBFC reduced the rating to a 12A on the grounds that the swearing took place "in a speech therapy context".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84830/billy.elliot" title=""&gt;Billy Elliot&lt;/a&gt; (2000)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137858/king-s-speech" title=""&gt;Reading on mobile? Watch the US trailer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contextually appropriate arguments didn't wash when it came to the swearing in Billy Elliot. The MPAA gave it an R – the same certification as Pulp Fiction. Perhaps swearing is less corrupting when it comes from the mouths of kings or (in the case of Philomena) dames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89588/amelie" title=""&gt;Amélie&lt;/a&gt; (2001)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fucking, even when among the privileged classes, must be restricted to profanities. Amélie couldn't keep "&lt;em&gt;les coeurs beaucoup plus chauds&lt;/em&gt;" and yet in spite of this, it is certified an R in the US for sexual content and 15 in the UK. In Sweden and Denmark you're OK to watch it if over seven, in Germany you can be just six, and in France – surprise, surprise – there's no age restriction at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115138/texas.chainsaw.massacre" title=""&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning&lt;/a&gt; (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yTobqXy7X8" title=""&gt;Reading on mobile? Watch the trailer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not only sex the French are "&lt;em&gt;plus tranquil&lt;/em&gt;" about but also, as the MPAA terms it, "extreme sadistic violence". In France, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is deemed suitable for all those over 16. Their Gallic Canadian cousins are similarly relaxed and the film board of Quebec rated the movie at 16+. Things can get confusing for Canadians. To watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario persons under 18 have to be accompanied by an adult, while in Manitoba and the Maritimes viewing is restricted for those of 18 years old and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86565/spider-man" title=""&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCkaYHVyezg" title=""&gt;Reading on mobile? Watch the trailer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Film classifications vary by region in the UK as well as Canada. Although rarely implemented, local authorities have the power to overturn the rating decisions of the BBFC. In 2002 North Norfolk and Breckland councils did just that when they lowered the classification for the Spiderman film from a 12A to PG. If Spider-Man appeared on children's cereal boxes, they argued, clearly there was no reason children shouldn't watch him in a film. Perhaps they would have revised their opinions concerning Spider-Man's wholesomeness had they checked the sugar content of Kellogg's Coco Pops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36144/gone.with.the.wind" title=""&gt;Gone with the Wind&lt;/a&gt; (1939)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is unusual to find films that Sweden has qualms about showing to its young folk, Gone with the Wind is one example. Even after the sweeping American civil war epic was re-rated by Sweden in 1985, it was thought only suitable for those over 11. In America, on the other hand, the last time Gone with the Wind was submitted for rating in 1971, the MPAA must have determined that prostitution, child death, military violence, rape threats, casual racism and a very famous "damn" were not worth giving one about, and rated the film as suitable for all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142864/help" title=""&gt;The Help&lt;/a&gt; (2011)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVTMkINRChk" title=""&gt;Reading on mobile? Watch the trailer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to this newer film about female empowerment and race politics in the Deep South, the ratings of Sweden and the United States are more or less reversed. In liberal Sweden, The Help is certified as suitable for all those over seven, whereas in the US you had to be over 13 to see it at the cinema unless accompanied by an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8) &lt;a href="http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer/0,4267,36480,00.html" title=""&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/a&gt; (1998)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the reason Gone with the Wind received its universal rating is its classic status. The MPAA has a let-out called the, "masterpiece exception". This allows films that would otherwise be rated NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted – a box office killer in the USA) to be given an R rating instead. The problem with this is that someone has to decide which films count as masterpieces and which films do not. Critics of the system argue that this has led to indie films being given higher ratings than more mainstream Hollywood fare such as Saving Private Ryan (rated R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96936/lost.in.translation" title=""&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;/a&gt; (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU0oZsqeG_s" title=""&gt;Reading on mobile? Watch the trailer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A film with such wildly different certifications among nations that it truly demonstrates quite how far cultural sensibilities can be lost in translation. At one end of the scale it's rated as either PG or universally suitable in Australia and Canada, in Spain you have to be 13, in the UK 15, and in America you had to be 17 to see at the cinema unless accompanied by an adult. But at least some Americans could see it; in Malaysia it's banned. As is Avatar in China, Zoolander in Iran, and Sex and the City 2 in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry"&gt;Film industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship"&gt;Censorship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Short of a criminal conviction, there is no legal authority that can force Ford from office, so his fellow lawmakers took the unprecedented step of removing the mayor's powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday it was within Ford's authority to appoint councillors to municipal committees as well as to take control of the city in the event of an emergency. After the weekend, Ford is expected to be stripped of his CDN$1.9m (£1.1m) office budget and the majority of his staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedural rebukes will result in Ford losing everything but his title. His former powers will be handed to Toronto's deputy mayor, Norm Kelly, a 20-year veteran of city hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The few people still standing by Mayor Ford are suggesting something akin to a coup d'état has taken place in a city whose credentials as a functioning democracy have never been called into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Three-hundred and eighty-three thousand people didn't vote for the deputy mayor," said Doug Ford, his city councillor brother. "They didn't vote for you councillors to take the powers of someone who was democratically elected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford, who admitted this week that he has begun consultations with a team of "health professionals", was more contrite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I completely understand the situation my fellow colleagues are in," he said, adding that if he were not the target of all this ire "I would have supported what they are doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it wouldn't have cost the taxpayers an arm and a leg, I would have done the exact same thing," he added, as he vowed to challenge the council's actions in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Ford's contrition after months of denials and defiance comes from anywhere, it may be the slow surge of public anger that is increasingly confident in speaking out against him. Under pressure from the media and with the support of his former allies on city council waning, Ford was asked this week not to march in Toronto's annual Santa Claus parade. The former youth football coach was also asked to stay clear of an important match between his beloved Toronto Argonauts and their provincial rivals, the Hamilton Tiger Cats. Even school visits to city hall have now been redirected to the city's archival library, apparently for health and safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish there was some other route that could be followed," said city councillor John Fillion. "Council has given the mayor advice and requests and he's chosen not to follow them, and I think this is the only course of action left to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "We've been frankly fortunate that no emergencies have landed on the same dates that we know the mayor's judgment may have been impaired."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/rob-ford"&gt;Rob Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/allan-woods"&gt;Allan Woods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Plenums in 1978 and 1993 laid the foundations for China's current economic model, a combination of market capitalism and tight political control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples in which one member is an only child will be allowed to have two children, China's state newswire Xinhua reported , citing the results of the plenumwhich ended in Beijing on Tuesday. While most people in China are still only allowed to have one child, some groups, including ethnic minorities, disabled people, and couples in which both members are only children, are allowed to have two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the document, the Communist party also plans to scrap its extrajudicial "re-education through labour" detention system, improve social welfare programs, and ease migration restrictions for the tens of millions of rural residents attempting to put down roots in cities. Details of the reforms and timelines for their implementation are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party established its re-education through labour system in 1957 at the height of Maoist fervour to expediently dispatch "counter-revolutionaries". More recently, local authorities have used it to clear their streets of petty criminals, such as thieves and prostitutes, without the burden of due process. Other common targets include political dissidents and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/china-tang-hui-labour-camp" title=""&gt;members of banned religious groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentences may last up to four years, and conditions in prison are often described as brutal – prisoners are crammed into tiny cells, deprived of adequate sustenance, and sometimes tortured. Despite an absence of official statistics, human rights groups say that the number of detainees could range from nearly 200,000 to millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because re-education through labour was so closely associated with political persecution, because conditions in the camps are so horrific, and because there have been decades of pressure for China to abandon this system, we should take this as a positive step," said Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong-based senior researcher for Human Rights Watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I think the caveat is that we don't know whether or not China intends to establish a new system of administrative detention – that is, a system of deprivation of liberty without the benefits of a trial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also pledged to "accelerate" reform of the hukou system, essentially a bureaucratic knot tying hundreds of millions of migrant workers to their rural hometowns. "The country will relax overall control over farmers settling in towns and small cities, and relax restrictions on settling in medium-sized cities in an orderly manner," &lt;a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013cpctps/2013-11/15/content_17106759.htm" title=""&gt;Xinhua reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have called the controversial one-child policy, introduced in 1979 to keep population growth in check, outdated and cruel. In the cities, it has created a demographic crunch, catching second-generation only-children in a financial bind as they struggle to support two parents and four grandparents. In the countryside, it has fuelled a rise in sex-selective abortions, as many rural families prefer boys to girls, and a host of human rights violations – abductions, forced abortions, extralegal detentions – as family planning authorities use extreme &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/19/china-family-planning-officials-fines" title=""&gt;measures to keep birth rates low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Tsang, professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham, said that the government's unwillingness to abolish the policy altogether suggests that it is most concerned with its economic costs. "Until now, the growth of the Chinese economy has been propelled by a demographic surplus, and that has been turning into a demographic deficit," he said. "The only way you can address the human rights abuses is to end the system entirely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is good news – one child is too lonely. I have a brother and I was happy as a little girl even though our family was poor," said Hu Hongling, a 33-year-old woman from the rural Anhui province who lives in Beijing with her husband. "My husband is an only child and he sometimes feels lonely. It's difficult for him to make friends." Hu is currently planning to have her first child; she hopes someday to have two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the policy's relaxation is unlikely to lead to a population boom. Many urbanites, already burdened by rocketing education and housing costs, consider multiple children an exclusive province of the rich. Zhang Xin, a 39-year-old media worker in Beijing, is newly eligible to have two children – he is an only child, his wife has siblings, and they already have a seven-year-old son. Yet "the new policy doesn't make a big difference for me," he said. "I don't think we could afford another child, in terms of time and financial pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plenum report detailed a number of less dramatic reforms, including promises to explore ways of setting up an intellectual property court, reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty, and "build a more impartial, sustainable social security system, with an improved housing guarantee mechanism".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also laced with a number of contradictions. While officials promised to ensure "independent, fair use of judicial authority" and uphold the country's constitution – which promises freedom of assembly and freedom of speech – they also pledged to "strengthen public opinion guidance and crack down on internet crimes," suggesting that media and internet censorship policies will remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do know that rule of law has become more of a rhetorical constant in Chinese language, and speaks to things that China finds important, for example, internationalisation," said Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese studies at Oxford University. "If you can show genuine progress in fields such as criminal law, that will give you more credibility in other areas, such as international finance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "It's obvious but worth saying that this is, yet again, the party making it clear that it is in no way going to relax its grip on power. It doesn't suggest the greater liberalisation or pluralisation of politics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Cecily Huang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/population"&gt;Population&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-kaiman"&gt;Jonathan Kaiman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
